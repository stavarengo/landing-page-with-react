Questions

- The page is divided in multiples section, for example: "Direct Naar", "Evenementen", "Blogs", etc. All of these
  section has two icons on the right of the title bar: One down arrow and a "X". My question is about the "X" icon. What
  should happens if the users click on this icon? The section should disapear? If so, when the user refresh the page it
  would come back again?
- I didn't understaind the item 3 of the "Accordion". The item 3 says: "Make sure that when you click on the head of a
  closed block, that you have to change (earlier) the open blocks that are closed. This must be an option that can be
  turned on or of when creating the object.". Is it saying that the Accordion can not have 2 sections open at the same
  time? When you say "This must be an option", it means an option for the user or an options in the code for others
  developers?
- I didn't understaind this: "These templates will ultimately be used in a headless installation. The dates in the
  templates coming from web services through JSON and the routing becomes cared for in the frontend.".
