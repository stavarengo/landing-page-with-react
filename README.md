# Landing Page With React

## See it live
If you want to see it live, go to: [Dutch](http://landing-page-with-react.stavarengo.me/nl) or [English](http://landing-page-with-react.stavarengo.me/en).

## Run locally

In the project directory, run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
````
This will start the application in `development` mode, thus the website will only be served in English.

If you want to run it locally as if it were in `production`, use the following commands:
```bash
$ npm install
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run start-express-ssr
````
In `production` mode you will be able to switch between the Dutch and English versions.
